	 * List of PCBs (in project view) add PCB version to the PCB name

	 * Open new link in the same window (I keep opning too many tabs all the time)
	 * Sitemap - make wa bit wider, so the "shooping list" fits in it.
	 * sitemap - move projects just above PCB
	 * sitemap - remove the "sitemap" text from the list
	 * Component view - replace the ID number with Part Number (should still say "Component" then the number)
	 * Location view - replace location ID number with Location name

	 * Projects: background image broken.
0.33.0
	 * Component quantity used counter - it is near impossible and too difficult to show how many parts are used across all projects and PCBs. THe list of projects and PCB's the part is in is enough. I.e. remove the "Used: xx" from the part view.
	 * In part view, where it says location, remove how many that location has available of this part (since it calculates negative numbers for not owned parts)
	 * Location view - the part number column should be autoqidening for longer part names. THe quantity should be in the next column, not in the brackets.
	 * Further update to add separate components to a project, in addition to PCBs, so that hardware pieces not part of any PCB can be added.
	 * List of parts in a project will list all the separately added parts, not ones from PCB
	 * PCB list - make another column for version, do not show in the PCB name (no longer right adjust the name). This pending on the tree view.
	 * Bottom of components list - make the Page Next, 1, 2, ... Previous text bigger and a bit more separated. E.g. 1 is further away from 2 and so on (easier to click)
	 * PCB view - if a next version exists, show a link, just like the previous version is shown (if not, show "current ver.")
	 * Project edit - possible to have an edit window to choose which part of the picture is the background, such as is with avatars for some websites. Basically one could choose the central part to show. Currently it stretches the picture so that only the corner is shown, which actually doesn't convey much about the project.
	 * PCB view - make the location without a frame (just like in Project view)
	 * PCB - add the production costs. this will be shown above Total costs in PCB view (under PCB name) Total cost will include this value
	 * Updated costs for PCB
	 * updated costs for Projects
	 * parts list (in PCB view for example) parts with longer names  overrun into the package column (see picture)
0.32.2
	 * PCB view - show PCB version just after the PCB name (same font and size), no space, no description
	 * PCB naming system: Name is sandalone, repeats amongs all PCB of the same type. The version, a separate field also typed in manually. THe previous version would be a smart thing, it would search all PCBs and from the ones with the same name it would select the most recent previous version. THis is to be manually overrideable in cases where there are parallel PCB branches, e.g. 1C and 2A.
	 * All - add another save button to the top of window, (next to the 3 ones, if possible)
	 * Project view - long project names split into two lines. the second line overlaps the first line and letter are joined.
	 * Project view - long project names - the end date is split into two lines and the day is separated from month and year. Possible to make the entire END date be on the next line?
	 * Creating new location -it pops up a note saying "location already exists. Editing instead" But still created the location no problem and shows it's view page, not editing.
	 * When editing PCB - no way to delete a photo (no tick box), it just says there is no photo
	 * Component price - the number of significant figures must be more than 2 (i.e. prices may be as varied as 0.0001)
	 * Component properties - current, voltage etc should be in numbers more detailed that 0.00. e.g. current can be 0.001 but it wants rounded to 0.00.
	 * change welcome index page background
	 * change Project background and layout
	 * changed welcome index project logo
